Hello! My name is Oskar and I'm a prospective software engineer or developer.

My strengths are Java and Lua, with working knowledge of C, C++, Javascript, HTLM5, CSS3, SQL, Python, Haxe... and probably more!

I'm using these repos to store and showcase a handful of my more refined coding projects.
